## 🙎🏻‍♀️ About Me

I'm a junior machine learning engineer currently working on recommendation systems in the travel industry. I love learning new things and sharing knowledge with the community.

I've been incredibly fortunate to learn so much from the open-source community and those who generously share their expertise. This blog is my way of giving back — even if it's just a small contribution, I hope something here might help someone on their own learning journey.
